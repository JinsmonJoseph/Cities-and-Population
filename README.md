# Cities-and-Population
A program to display cities and population from a CSV file and display it as a scatter diagram and bar diagram as part of my Advanced python Course.
The program takes input from user through command line and stores the data into a CSV file using csv library.Then the data is retrieved from CSV and converted to scatter diagram and bar diagram using matplotlib library.
